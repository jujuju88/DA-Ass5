## Conclusion

There are some errors in the predictions of the exact location of where each seismic event occurs on the boxplot graph. So we can look into the source.
Most of the predictions are based on the ml, md,mb techniques or algorithms to calculate the magnitude. So we can explore further these techniques and
improve the accuracy for the future.

Next, we use a line plot to visually the patterns of the average seismic level for the last month. The magnitudes alternate within 1.25 and 1.75 which 
is consistent and we shouldn't be worried for major earthquakes.

Then, we went on to explore which level of depths in km were causing the magnitudes of seismic events. At level 6 were the highest average magnitude.

Hence, we explored the relationship between the magnitude and the depth relative to the sea level of the earthquakes' ruptures. 
We found that there is a positive correlation where it's also exponential: meaning the deeper the rupture occurs, the higher the magnitude.

For the past month, there has not been any major earthquakes to be worried of. Further investigation about the methods of determining the exact location
of seismic events could improve better prediction.
